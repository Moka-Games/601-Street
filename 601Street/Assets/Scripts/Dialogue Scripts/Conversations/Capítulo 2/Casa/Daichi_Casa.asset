  - speakerName: Daichi
    content: Oooh, so you finally got around to looking at the little page of the
      enlightened ones.
  - speakerName: Nyssa
    content: Yes, it has many coincidences with my mother's case... and with Umi's.
  - speakerName: Daichi
    content: Really? You're not making a movie all by yourself? You're going strong,
      huh.
  - speakerName: Nyssa
    content: I am not making this up. I've started having the same visions you describe
      there.
  - speakerName: Daichi
    content: Hahahaha! Oh, Nyssa... you're bordering on clinical. You look terrible,
      really.
  - speakerName: Nyssa
    content: I think I should talk to them. They may know something else.
  - speakerName: Daichi
    content: "\rYou? With those people? Please! Hahahaha, okay, okay... If you're
      excited to play paranormal detective, go ahead. They say they meet in a half-dead
      building by the park, don't forget the \u201Cpassword\u201D."
  - speakerName: Daichi
    content: But hey, don't disappear too, okay? I'd be too lazy to go looking for
      you. I'll call you later... if you haven't been delivered as an offering by
      now. Chaooo!
