  - speakerName: Daichi
    content: How's it going, little padawan? I heard that you went to the police
      station to tell them about Umi.
  - speakerName: Nyssa
    content: Yes... I found something about my mother's case. Maybe it will be of
      some use.
  - speakerName: Daichi
    content: Oh yeah? Wow, you're really motivated. Well, changing the subject...
      About Umi, I found the page she was probably looking at before she disappeared.
      A nest of hangers-on talking about paranormal stuff. A laugh, really.
  - speakerName: Daichi
    content: Anyway, I left it in the email, to keep you entertained for a while.
      Go on, go home and look at it.
