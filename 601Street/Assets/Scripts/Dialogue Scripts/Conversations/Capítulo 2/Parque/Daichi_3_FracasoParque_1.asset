    content: "Man, if it isn't the supernatural detective! What happened, huh? Did
      you stay out of the meeting? Oh, what a pity... I bet you scared them with

  - speakerName: Daichi
    content: Don't cry. I have something that might cheer you up. Well... or frustrate
      you even more, that's up to you.
  - speakerName: Daichi
    content: Before I tell you where you should really go, I need you to do a little
      favor for me. A test, let's call it... something to keep you busy.
  - speakerName: Daichi
    content: In the park, near the cotton candy stand is a box. It's not hard to
      find... if you know where to look.
  - speakerName: Daichi
    content: Inside is a puzzle. No big deal... if you have more than two active
      neurons. Solve it and maybe, maybe, it will tell you where you should be right
      now.
  - speakerName: Daichi
    content: But hurry up, Nyssa. Don't be late again.
