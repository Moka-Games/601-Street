  - speakerName: Daichi
    content: So, have you achieved anything other than pure delusion?
  - speakerName: Nyssa
    content: Apparently there is an abandoned house... and a portal. Everything seems
      to be connected.
  - speakerName: Daichi
    content: A portal? Wow, now you've really gotten into the weird side of the internet.
  - speakerName: Nyssa
    content: No kidding. They also mention a family of wizards... they say there
      is only one living descendant left.
  - speakerName: Daichi
    content: Ugh, wizards, portals, haunted houses... You're missing a dragon and
      you've got the whole movie.
  - speakerName: Daichi
    content: Anyway.... you have to start somewhere. Go to that abandoned house and
      see if you can find something that won't devour you. And if it does... take
      pictures!
