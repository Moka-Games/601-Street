  - speakerName: Police Officer
    content: I don't really have many details. But we're going to open an investigation
      into Umi's case. As for your mother... The best person to talk to about that
      would be <Bold>(Nakamura)</Bold>, the officer who handled her case.
  - speakerName: Nyssa
    content: Where can I find him?
  - speakerName: Police Officer
    content: He retired. That case affected him too much and ended up affecting his

      bar somewhere.
