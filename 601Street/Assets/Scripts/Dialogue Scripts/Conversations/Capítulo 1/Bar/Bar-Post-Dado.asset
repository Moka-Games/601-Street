  dialogues:
  - speakerName: Nakamura
    content: (sighs, rubbing his face) Damn it... Of course, I remember. That case...
      it marked me for life. It even haunted me in my dreams. It was too much, that's
      why I retired.
  - speakerName: Nyssa
    content: "I knew it... I always felt the truth was buried. Now my friend has
      disappeared, and I think there\u2019s a connection between both cases."
  - speakerName: Nakamura
    content: (blinks, surprised) A connection? How?
  - speakerName: Nyssa
    content: There are too many coincidences. The same patterns, the same intervals
      of time. If you know anything that could help me, I need you to speak.
  - speakerName: Nakamura
    content: (takes a drink, thinking) Damn... If you're right, this is much bigger
      than I thought.
  - speakerName: Nyssa
    content: What can I do then?
  - speakerName: Nakamura
    content: In my old office, there's a safe, you'll find all the case information
      there. Take this.
