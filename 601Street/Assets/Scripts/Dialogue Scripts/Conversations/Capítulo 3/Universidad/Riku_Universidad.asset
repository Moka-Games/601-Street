  dialogues:
  - speakerName: Nyssa
    content: Riku... I need to talk to you. It's important.
  - speakerName: Riku
    content: You? The girl with the apple? What are you doing here?
  - speakerName: Nyssa
    content: 'I was in the abandoned house. I found a notebook with your name on
      it. Your family... the Kurobane. It''s all there: rituals, symbols, dates.'
  - speakerName: Riku
    content: (surprised, lowering his voice) What are you saying? Have you been poking
      around in things you don't understand?
  - speakerName: Nyssa
    content: I'm saying there is a portal, Riku. One that opened years ago in this
      city. And you are connected to it, to all of this.
  - speakerName: Riku
    content: Why are you telling me? I don't know anything about portals or rituals.
  - speakerName: Nyssa
    content: My friend Umi disappeared a few days ago. And my mother... disappeared
      years ago, under similar circumstances. There are no coincidences here, Riku.
      It's all connected. I need to know what's going on. And you can help me.
  - speakerName: Riku
    content: (visibly uncomfortable) Look... I don't know if I want to get into all
      this. If what you say is true, then this is beyond us.
  dialogueOptions:
  - optionText: I know you are afraid. I'm afraid too. But if we don't do it together,
      maybe no one else will.
