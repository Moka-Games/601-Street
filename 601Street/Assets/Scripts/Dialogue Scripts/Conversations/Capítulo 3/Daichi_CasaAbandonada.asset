  dialogues:
  - speakerName: Nyssa
    content: I left the house. I found a notebook. It's Riku's... the boy from the
      park. It's all in there, Daichi. His full name, symbols, rituals, dates. He's
      the last descendant of the wizard family.
  - speakerName: Daichi
    content: What? The kid with the apple? Fuck me! Hahahaha! How wonderful... always
      so quiet, and it turns out that magic is in his blood.
  - speakerName: Nyssa
    content: "Don't laugh. It's serious. According to what I read, years ago a portal
      was opened in this city. A kind of access to another reality... they called
      it \u201Cthe threshold to immortality\u201D. And Riku... he's connected to
      it."
  - speakerName: Daichi
    content: Well, well... things are getting juicy. What now? Are you going to ask
      the scion of the lost lineage for a magical interview?
  - speakerName: Nyssa
    content: I need to find him. If anyone knows what's really going on, it's him.
      There has to be a reason why he's here, now. I'm going to college.
  - speakerName: Daichi
    content: 'To college, of course... What a classic. Good luck with Riku. Oh, and
      before I forget... that house you came out of, the abandoned one. It''s starting
      to be a problem. Noises, lights, things that shouldn''t be there. If you have
      anything of value left, get it out now... Then you decide: close it, seal it...
      or burn it. No one will miss it.'
